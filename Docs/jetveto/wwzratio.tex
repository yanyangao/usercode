In this section, we describe the $WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency 
ratio $R_{WW/Z}$ (Equation~\ref{eq:wweff}) estimation. 
$WW$ production has different kinematics from the $Z$, as 
the energy scale in the former is much larger than the latter 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:wwz_pthat}, left).
This indicates that the incoming partons %$q\bar{q}$ 
in $WW$ production have a larger energy on average than $Z$ production, 
which results in a harder ISR parton energy spectrum, 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wwz_pthat} (right). 

Figure~\ref{fig:wwzratio}-\ref{fig:wwzratio_JEC} show 
the $WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency ratio dependence on the 
leading jet \pt\,, using the uncorrected and corrected jets respectively. 
The predictions from Madgraph agree with the MC@NLO within 1-2\%.
The predictions from Pythia MC differ from the 
other two in the order of 10\% on average. 
Note that the jet-veto efficiencies in the $Z$ control region 
from Pythia and Madgraph MC samples agree within 3\% (section~\ref{sec:zeff}). 
The large Pythia/Madgraph difference in the $R_{WW/Z}$ 
is due to the different leading jet \pt\, spectrum in the 
$WW$ productions. More specifically, Pythia predicts a much softer 
jet energy spectrum than Madgraph in the $WW$ production. 

In Pythia, the matrix element calculation for $WW$ production 
includes only the leading order contributions. 
The ISR is modeled through the parton 
showering in the soft-collinear limit. 
On the other hand, both Madgraph and MC@NLO MCs 
take into account upto 1 parton ISR in the matrix element calculation.
The large Pythia/Madgraph difference could be due to the 
imperfect modelling of ISR in Pythia parton showering. 
The good agreement between Pythia and Madgraph in the 
$Z$ jet-veto efficiency is likely because Pythia parton 
showering is tuned well on $Z$ region using data. 

To disentangle the jet reconstruction differences, we study the 
$WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency ratio dependence on both the generator level 
jet energy and the parton energy, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wwzratio_mcfm}. 
The large difference of Pythia predictions from Madgraph and MC@NLO 
persists at the generator level. 
We use the MCFM\cite{ref:mcfm} MC generator to probe the $WW/Z$ jet-veto 
efficency ration dependence on the matrix element level parton energy. 
The events are generated with up to 1 extra parton in the final states. 
The parton $\pt$ is taken as the magnitude of the recoiling four or two 
leptons \pt in the $WW\to 2l2\nu$ or $pp\to Z\to 2l$ decays. 
The jet-veto efficiency curve obtained using the parton \pt\, is between 
Pythia and Madgraph (MC@NLO). 
We change the normalization ($\mu_R$) and factorization ($\mu_F$) scales 
to $1/2$ and $2$ times the conventional values, and 
find the differences in the jet-veto efficiency 
smaller than the Pythia/Madgraph differences. 

We choose Madgraph as the MC sample to calculate the 
$WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency ratio $R_{WW/Z}^{MC}$. 
This is because Madgraph MC predicts well the jet-veto efficiency 
in $Z$ events, and it includes extra one-parton radiation in the 
matrix element calculation of $WW$ production. 
We assign half the Pythia/Madgraph difference as the systematic error 
for $R_{WW/Z}^{MC}$. The results are tabulated 
Table~\ref{tab:wwzratio_results}-\ref{tab:wwzratio_jec_results} 
using the uncorrected and corrected PFJets 
for three different jet energy cut (20, 25, 30) GeV.
