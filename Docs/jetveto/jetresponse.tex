The jet energy correction~\cite{jet-7tev} 
uncertainties give rise to addtional uncertainties in evaluating both 
the $Z$ jet-veto efficiency and the $WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency ratios. 

The bulk of the jet energy correction are the L2L3 corrections, 
see Figure~\ref{fig:jec} (left). The same L2L3 corrections are 
applied to both data and MC. 
For the data, additional residual corrections (Figure~\ref{fig:jec}, right) 
are applied to improve the data/MC agreement~\cite{jec-kostas}. 
The jet energy correction at the \pt\, range of (20-30) GeV are 
important for the jet-veto signal efficiency. 
As the jet energy corrections are primarily derived for the high \pt\, jets, 
we perform a simple cross check on the data/MC comparisons 
of the jet response, using the $Z$+jet events, similar to the 
method described in ~\cite{jec-zbalance}.

The $Z$+jet events are selected with the following two additional 
requirements beyond the selections described in section~\ref{sec:zeff}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item
The leading jet and the $Z$ are back-to-back: $|\Delta\phi (\vec{p}_{leading jet} - \vec{p}_Z)| < 0.2$;
\item
The maximum \pt\, of other jets in the event is $0.1\times p_T(leading jet)$.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{fig:jec_pfjet} shows the jet energy scale derived from the 
$Z$+jet events for the PFJet. The jet energy scale is defined as the 
$p_T(leading jet)/p_T(Z)$. We see a small systematic shift about 5\% for 
the jets at \pt\, range of (20-30) GeV. However, the data is statistically 
limited. Note that The efficiency difference for a correction around 
11\% (Figure~\ref{fig:jec}, left) yields a difference about 4\% 
in the $Z$ jet-veto efficency uncertainty and 1\% in the 
$R_{WW/Z}$. 
We estimate that jet energy correction induced systematic uncertainty 
is less than 2\%, assuming the jet energy correction uncertainty is 5\%. 
For the time being, the contributions of this difference is 
ignored in the jet-veto efficiency estimation. 
We will repeat the study with more data and apply appropriate corrections 
based on more precise measurement of this data/MC shift. 


%Theredata/MC jec energy correction shift about 5\% 
%introduces roughly 2\% additional uncertainty in the $WW/Z$ jet-veto 
%efficiency ratio $R_{WW/Z}$.
