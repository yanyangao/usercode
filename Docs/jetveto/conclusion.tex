In summary, we have described a partially data-driven method to 
estimate the $WW$ jet-veto efficiency and its systematic uncertainties 
in data. The $WW$ jet-veto efficiency in data is parametrized as the product 
of the $Z$ jet-veto efficiency in data and the $WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency 
in MC. 

The $Z$ jet-veto efficiency is measured in data and 
compared to various MC samples, shown in 
Table~\ref{tab:zeff_results}-\ref{tab:zeff_jec_results}. 
We have observed good agreement between data and the Pythia
 and Madgraph MC samples. 
The jet-veto efficiency predicted by MC@NLO is found to be 
larger than the measurement in data.

On the other hand, we have compared the $WW/Z$ jet-veto 
efficiency ratio using the Pythia, Madgraph and MC@NLO MC samples. 
The predictions from the Madgraph and MC@NLO MC samples 
agree with each other within 1\%. 
The $WW$ jet energy spectrum in Pythia is significantly softer 
than the other two, yielding a difference of more than 10\% in the 
$WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency ratio at the jet \pt\, cut of 20 GeV. 
Based on the above findings, we choose Madgraph as the 
nominal MC to calculate the $WW/Z$ jet-veto efficiency ratio 
and assign half of the difference between the Pythia and Madgraph 
predictions as the $R_{WW/Z}^{MC}$ uncertainties. 

The $WW$ jet-veto efficiencies using uncorrected and 
corrected PFJets at \pt\, cut of (20, 25, 30) GeV are tabulated 
in Table~\ref{tab:wweff_results}-\ref{tab:wweff_jec_results}.
